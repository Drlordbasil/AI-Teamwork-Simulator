**AI-TeamPlay: AI-Powered Teamwork Dynamics**

Welcome to AI-TeamPlay, where artificial intelligence takes on the dynamics of teamwork in a simulated tech environment. Here's a glimpse into the text-based workflow that brings this digital workspace to life:

1. **Initialize**: The simulation kicks off with AI agents booting up, each representing a different role in a tech team - from a DevOps guru to a Data Scientist.

2. **Collaborate**: Agents use text-based communication, like sending emails or messages, to collaborate, mimicking real-world team interactions.

3. **Decision Making**: Each agent processes information and makes decisions on what actions to take next, whether it's writing code, testing software, or discussing strategies.

4. **Perform Tasks**: Agents execute tasks using a variety of skills - coding, testing, deploying - all within the text command interface.

5. **Share Results**: Once tasks are completed, results are shared among the team, leading to new discussions and further actions.
